## Overview

The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically increased reliance on home Internet connections for work, education, healthcare, and daily life. Our research examined how the Internet performed during this unprecedented shift and how service providers responded to increased demand.

## Research Areas

### Mapping the Digital Divide

We analyzed Internet connectivity patterns before, during, and after the onset of COVID-19 to understand how the pandemic exposed and exacerbated existing disparities in Internet access across communities.

### Service Provider Response

We characterized how Internet service providers in the United States responded to the pandemic, examining changes in network performance, capacity, and service delivery during periods of dramatically increased usage.

### Chicago Connected

In partnership with Chicago Public Schools and the Chicago Consortium on School Research, we evaluated how Chicago Connected—a free Internet connectivity program for public school students—benefited groups of students from different socioeconomic backgrounds and residential locations.

## Key Findings

- The pandemic exposed significant disparities in Internet access at neighborhood scales
- In Chicago, more than 110,000 children under 18 lacked broadband access at the start of the pandemic
- In certain neighborhoods, nearly half of children under 18 lacked Internet connectivity
- Service providers generally maintained performance despite increased demand
