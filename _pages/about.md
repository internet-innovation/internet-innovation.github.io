# Internet Innovation Initiative

The [Internet Innovation Initiative](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago develops tools and techniques for measuring Internet performance and connectivity. Our work focuses on device-based measurement using open-source software that runs on commodity hardware like Raspberry Pi devices.

Read more about the initiative [here](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/about/the-initiative).

## Current Research

Our current research focuses on several key areas:

- **Internet Performance Measurement**: Developing scalable systems for measuring broadband connectivity
  - [FLOTO](/projects/floto/): Large-scale edge device deployment for broadband research
  - [Netrics](/projects/netrics/): Open-source Internet performance measurement system

- **Data Collection and Analysis**: Gathering and releasing Internet performance data
  - [Household Internet Performance Data](https://github.com/internet-equity/netrics-data): Quarterly releases from our deployments

- **Visualization and Dashboards**: Making network data accessible and actionable
  - [Netrics Dashboard](/projects/netrics-dash/): Web interface for visualizing device measurements

## Projects

Explore our research [projects](/projects/).

## Data and Code

We release datasets, code, and tools to enable reproducible research. Visit our [Data & Code](/datasets-code/) page to access our resources.

## Get Involved

We are seeking volunteers to host measurement devices. Learn about how to get involved by visiting our [FLOTO participation page](/floto/participate/).
