The [Internet Innovation Initiative](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu) at the University of Chicago develops tools and techniques for measuring Internet performance and connectivity. Our work focuses on device-based measurement using open-source software that runs on commodity hardware like Raspberry Pi devices.

Read more about the initiative [here](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/about/the-initiative).

## Current Research

Our current research focuses on several key areas:

- **Internet Performance Measurement**: Developing scalable systems for measuring broadband connectivity
  - [Netrics](/projects/2-netrics/): Open-source Internet performance measurement system

- **Data Collection and Analysis**: Gathering and releasing Internet performance data
  - [Household Internet Performance Data](https://github.com/internet-equity/netrics-data): Quarterly releases from our deployments

- **Visualization and Dashboards**: Making network data accessible and actionable
  - [Netrics Dashboard](/projects/3-netrics-dash/): Web interface for visualizing device measurements
