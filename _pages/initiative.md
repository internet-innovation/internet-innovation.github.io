The Internet Innovation Initiative endeavors to realize resilient and sustainable Internet solutions that benefit all communities.

## The Problem

Reliance on the Internet has grown exponentially in recent years, for work, education, healthcare, and daily life. Yet significant disparities in Internet access persist in communities around the globe—and right here in Chicago. When the COVID-19 pandemic began in March of 2020, more than 110,000 children under the age of 18 lacked access to broadband Internet connectivity in the city of Chicago. In some neighborhoods, almost half of all children were not connected.

Policymakers have taken note, and a range of local and federal policy initiatives have responded to these concerns, from local programs such as Chicago Connected, to sweeping national legislation committing nearly $65 billion toward improvements in broadband infrastructure.

## What We Do

As policymakers determine how best to direct resources and evaluate the effectiveness of their investment, stakeholders at every level need better information about three key areas:

1. **Problem-driven measurement:** Current U.S. broadband data fails to represent broadband connectivity in underserved geographies. We develop a comprehensive approach to measurement across neighborhoods in Chicago that can serve as a replicable model for understanding urban Internet connectivity nationwide.

2. **Diverse connectivity models:** Different communities require tailored technical solutions that depend on local circumstances including infrastructure, building characteristics, and community dynamics.

3. **Infrastructure's social effects:** Our projects evaluate outcomes from programs like Chicago Connected and examine home connectivity's health impacts through partnerships with UChicago Medicine.

## Our Partners

The initiative partners the Department of Computer Science and Crown Family School of Social Work, Policy, and Practice at the University of Chicago.

We collaborate with organizations including [data.org](https://data.org), Ookla, the City of Chicago, Illinois Office of Broadband, and various community groups.
