## Overview

A research partnership between the Data Science Institute, a Data Science Clinic team, and the City of Chicago examined internet access disparities across Chicago's 77 community areas using U.S. Census Bureau data. The study aimed to identify neighborhoods with the lowest connectivity and understand how socioeconomic factors influence internet adoption.

## Key Findings

**Geographic Disparities:**
The analysis revealed that roughly 80 percent of Chicago households are connected to the Internet, but deep disparities in availability and adoption exist at the neighborhood level. The least-connected neighborhoods cluster on Chicago's South and West Sides, with Englewood, West Englewood, Fuller Park, and North Lawndale experiencing internet access rates between 57-60%, compared to 91% in Lakeview and Near South Side.

**Socioeconomic Correlations:**
Research identified strong connections between internet access and multiple demographic factors. Community areas with higher hardship scores—measuring crowded housing, poverty, unemployment, education gaps, dependency, and low per capita income—consistently showed lower connectivity rates.

**Most Influential Factors:**
Statistical analysis of individual-level data revealed that Internet access is most strongly correlated with household income and education. Households with elderly residents showed notably lower internet access, while Black and Hispanic populations faced greater connectivity barriers compared to White and Asian populations.

## Policy Recommendations

The researchers advocate for three approaches:
- Expanding affordability programs like Chicago Connected
- Developing community networks in underserved areas
- Providing digital literacy education, particularly for older populations
