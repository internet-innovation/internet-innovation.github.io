If you follow our research, you know that broadband measurement is at the heart of our project. The Internet Innovation Initiative's core insight is leveraging advances in edge computing and hardware to improve broadband measurement for research and policy while reducing the costs and complexity of managing edge deployments. Our work over the last two years has helped support multiple efforts by researchers and policymakers to collect robust broadband performance data needed for effective analysis and decision-making.

The recent work of three students from the University of Chicago Data Science Institute's Data Science Clinic further emphasizes the policy issues facing universal broadband access in the United States. The video summarizing their work and research is an excellent resource for understanding the complexities of broadband policy in the United States. It also surfaces the need for better broadband data in general to improve our methods of identifying where better infrastructure is needed the most.
