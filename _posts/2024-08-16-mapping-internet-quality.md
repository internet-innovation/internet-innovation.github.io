## Overview

The Internet Innovation Initiative's work in broadband measurement continues through collaboration with the University of Chicago. Three students completed research addressing broadband policy challenges affecting universal internet access in the United States.

## Key Points

Broadband measurement is at the heart of our project. The Internet Innovation Initiative leverages edge computing and hardware advances to enhance broadband measurement for research and policy applications while reducing deployment complexity and costs.

The students' presentation examines the complexities of broadband policy in the United States and underscores the necessity for improved broadband data to identify infrastructure gaps more effectively.

The research identifies a critical need for better broadband performance data to support infrastructure investment decisions.

## Funding

The Internet Innovation Initiative receives support through a National Science Foundation grant (Award No. 2213821 - CCRI CISE).
