## Overview

This data story examines whether upgrading your internet service plan guarantees improved performance when using WiFi connections. The research analyzes data from Netrics devices deployed in Chicago households to explore how WiFi setups can result in slower speeds than the access connection supports.

## Key Finding

WiFi bottlenecks—situations where wireless speeds fall below wired access speeds—are widespread. The analysis reveals that **89 percent** of studied households experienced at least one WiFi bottleneck during the analysis period.

## Main Insights

**Prevalence by Speed Tier:** Households subscribing to high-speed plans (200+ Mbps) experience significantly more WiFi bottlenecks than those with lower-tier plans. Among frequent bottleneck-experiencers, median access speed reached 686 Mbps, compared to 57 Mbps for those rarely experiencing bottlenecks.

**Performance Gap:** In the 800+ Mbps tier, the gap between purchased access speeds and actual experienced speeds reached 609 Mbps due to WiFi limitations.

## Recommendations for Consumers

The analysis suggests upgrading your router, relocating it for better coverage, or installing WiFi extenders may be more cost-effective than purchasing higher service tiers if WiFi is your bottleneck.

## Policy Implications

Infrastructure investments alone won't improve community internet equity without complementary policies providing appropriate WiFi equipment to households.
