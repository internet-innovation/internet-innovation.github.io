## Overview

Researchers at the University of Chicago's Internet Innovation Initiative conducted laboratory experiments to determine bandwidth requirements for popular video conferencing applications during the COVID-19 pandemic. The City of Chicago commissioned this study to help identify households lacking sufficient internet connectivity.

## Key Findings

**Single Call Performance:**
The three most-tested applications—Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams—required approximately 1-2 Mbps download and 0.75-1.4 Mbps upload speeds for individual calls. Most residential Internet plans provide plenty of capacity to handle this usage, with the FCC's broadband standard of 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload far exceeding typical needs.

**Multiple Simultaneous Calls:**
Problems emerge when multiple video conferences run simultaneously. The upload limits can come into play with only 2 simultaneous Teams meetings or 3-4 concurrent Zoom or Meet sessions, creating competition for bandwidth. Applications sometimes prioritize certain calls, degrading quality for others.

**Meeting Size Impact:**
Larger meetings with participants using speaker mode increased bandwidth demands, particularly stressing upload capacity on minimum-speed plans.

**Service Interruptions:**
When bandwidth dropped for 30 seconds, apps required 25 to 50 seconds to return to their pre-interruption performance.

## Policy Implications

Rather than relying solely on FCC broadband definitions, policymakers should establish household-level benchmarks addressing realistic usage scenarios—such as supporting multiple simultaneous remote school participants or work-from-home situations.
