## Overview

The Internet Innovation Initiative partnered with the Greater Englewood Chamber of Commerce to address digital inequity on Chicago's South Side. The collaboration emerged from a paradox: while fiber optic infrastructure existed beneath Englewood's streets, major internet service providers refused to activate it without guaranteed full-price subscriptions from residents.

## Key Challenge

The community needed empirical evidence to advocate for change beyond anecdotal complaints about slow speeds and unreliable connections.

## Solution Implemented

The Internet Innovation Initiative distributed speedtester devices to local business owners, enabling measurement of actual internet performance across the neighborhood. This data collection effort aimed to build a localized map of internet quality issues.

## The Initiative's Role

The project leveraged the Internet Innovation Initiative's infrastructure to:
- Measure connectivity reality
- Gather performance evidence
- Empower community advocacy through data-driven insights

## Next Steps

The partnership plans to expand device deployment to create comprehensive documentation of Englewood's internet landscape, supporting sustained advocacy campaigns for improved infrastructure access.

This case demonstrates how technology-guided community engagement can illuminate hidden inequities and catalyze meaningful change.
