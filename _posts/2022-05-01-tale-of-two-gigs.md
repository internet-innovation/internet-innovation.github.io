## Summary

This data story examines whether households subscribing to identical internet service plans from the same provider experience comparable performance across different Chicago neighborhoods.

## Key Findings

The research compared two households in Hyde Park and South Shore, both paying for Gigabit internet from Xfinity. The results revealed significant disparities: the Hyde Park household experienced higher-quality Internet than the South Shore household. Specific performance gaps included approximately 100 Mbps higher download speeds in Hyde Park and consistently lower latency measurements.

## Main Arguments

**Limitations of Existing Data:**
Crowdsourced datasets like Ookla Speedtest suffer from sampling bias, concentrating measurements in wealthier neighborhoods while missing underserved communities. Additionally, these tests often measure WiFi performance rather than actual ISP-delivered speeds, creating distorted pictures of connection quality.

**The Netrics Solution:**
The University of Chicago developed Netrics, a measurement platform providing continuous, household-level internet performance data. Unlike sporadic user-initiated tests, Netrics devices measure connections directly to a home's source of internet and run multiple tests daily.

## Conclusion

Achieving true digital equity requires monitoring not just internet availability but also performance quality across communities, necessitating continuous, fine-grained data on Internet performance.
