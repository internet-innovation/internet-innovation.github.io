This working document was developed in partnership with the City of Chicago in an effort to demystify broadband and work towards a more connected Chicago. It was informed by input from community-based organizations, including McKinley Park Development Council, Neighborhood Network Alliance, Resurrection Project, and South Shore Works. It is presented in three sections: basic terms, frequently asked questions, and finally a few myths.

## Terms and Definitions

**Broadband** describes "fast Internet" with FCC-defined minimums of 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload speeds, sufficient for simultaneous video streaming.

**Bandwidth/Speed** measure data transmission capacity. **Megabits per Second (Mbps)** is the standard unit; approximately 1 Mbps supports standard-definition YouTube viewing.

**Downstream/Download** refers to received data (streaming shows), while **Upstream/Upload** describes transmitted data (video calls, emails, photo uploads).

**Mobile Broadband** uses cellular networks via smartphones, while **Fixed Broadband** enters homes via cables. Mobile data typically has caps (AT&T: 30GB, Verizon: ~15GB monthly), whereas fixed broadband offers substantially more.

**Internet Service Providers (ISPs)** like Comcast, AT&T, RCN, and WOW deliver fixed broadband. **Cellular Carriers** (Verizon, Sprint, AT&T) provide mobile infrastructure and service.

**Devices** are Internet-connected electronics: computers, smartphones, tablets, smart appliances, security cameras, and entertainment systems.

**Ethernet** is standard short-distance in-home cabling resembling wide telephone plugs. A **Modem** converts ISP signals into usable formats. A **Router** directs data to appropriate devices via Ethernet ports or wireless transmission.

**Wi-Fi** broadcasts signals wirelessly over limited distances. The modem, router, and Wi-Fi often combine into single rental units.

**Coaxial Cable** ("coax") transmits data as electrical voltage, traditionally delivering television signals. **Fiber** uses glass/plastic cables transmitting data as light, offering significantly greater capacity than coaxial infrastructure.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Basics

**What is broadband Internet?**

Broadband is, in short, fast Internet. Current FCC standards require 25 Mbps downloads and 3 Mbps uploads. A 25 Mbps connection downloads 1 gigabyte in 5.3 minutes. Typical video conferencing uses 1-1.5 Mbps; Netflix uses approximately 1 Mbps.

**What is the difference between fixed broadband and mobile internet? Why are they not the same?**

Mobile broadband travels via radio waves to phones, generally available wherever cell service exists. Fixed broadband enters homes through cables (coaxial, fiber, or telephone lines). Fixed broadband typically proves faster and more reliable. 5G mobile technology approaches gigabit speeds, though capable devices remain expensive. Fixed broadband plans offer 1200+ gigabytes monthly; mobile plans impose stricter data limits.

**How does one connect to the internet? How does it actually work?**

The Internet comprises physical fiber, cables, and servers connecting globally, hosting the web and services like email and teleconferencing. Consumers access it through mobile carriers or ISPs providing either mobile or fixed connections. Public Wi-Fi from cafes and libraries also provides access.

**Does my internet speed change if I am plugged directly into the modem compared to getting service over Wi-Fi?**

Speed differences depend on Wi-Fi quality, configuration, and placement. ISP-rented hardware matches contracted speeds; personal equipment might not. Ethernet cables work effectively within 100 yards. Wi-Fi extenders help but require careful setup. Testing wired connections via speedtest.net reveals whether Wi-Fi limits performance.

**Why does my internet speed seem to be the same, even though I paid extra for more speed?**

Weak Wi-Fi becomes the limiting factor when connections appear unchanged despite upgraded contracts. ISPs provide speed-check tools; speedtest.net offers independent testing. Plugging directly into modems with Ethernet cables reveals actual ISP delivery speeds versus Wi-Fi limitations.

**How can I test my Internet speed?**

Visiting speedtest.net and clicking "Go" displays download speeds (typically emphasized), upload speeds, and connection quality. Broadband standards require 25 Mbps downloads and 3 Mbps uploads. Upload speeds frequently underperform the broadband definition.

### Connectivity in Chicago

**Why do only certain Internet Service Providers service my neighborhood?**

Internet infrastructure ownership remains with installing companies at substantial costs. Installation decisions reflect market density, uptake likelihood, and digging expenses. Historically, taxpayers funded Internet development through DARPA and NSF (1970s-1980s), but privatization (1994-1996) shifted infrastructure investment to private companies. The U.S. ranks among OECD's most expensive broadband countries, contrasting with government-funded backbone models elsewhere.

**Why does my neighbor get faster internet even though we have the same ISP and modem?**

Multiple factors affect speed: contracted speeds differ (higher-priced plans offer faster service); Wi-Fi performance varies; placement matters significantly (distance from metal objects, elevation, materials like brick affect signals); infrastructure may differ between neighborhoods; temporary conditions affect shared resources.

**Where are the City of Chicago open or free Wi-Fi spots in or near my community?**

Chicago libraries provide free Wi-Fi (map available online). Computer access and digital skills training locations exist citywide. Xfinity operates public Wi-Fi hotspots; Comcast created ten "lift zones" offering free community Internet. Chicago Public Schools students qualify for free Internet through the Chicago Connected program.

### Digital Literacy

**What is the potential that an Internet connection can bring you as an individual or a small business?**

Today's world operates through Internet-mediated communication and commerce. A 2019 survey found Americans use Internet for: email (90%), messaging (90%), social media (74%), video calls (51%), video streaming (74%), music/podcasts (56%), financial services (70%), shopping (72%). Over 10% of American adults have sold goods online; 7.5% have sold services online.

**Should I be nervous about online surveillance or other Internet privacy issues?**

Two distinct concerns emerge: intentional sharing and unintended exposure. Never provide personal data to unknown websites or email; avoid sending sensitive information like social security numbers electronically.

ISPs positioned between homes and the Internet observe traffic destinations but see limited content. Historically, most traffic was unencrypted, allowing ISP visibility into detailed activities. Currently, encryption makes content virtually unreadable even by ISPs, though traffic destinations remain visible. Domain Name System (DNS) and Server Name Indication (SNI) services remain unencrypted.

Cellular carriers and online services (Google, Facebook) maintain more extensive data collection and tracking histories than traditional ISPs. Google records searches and location visits; traditional ISPs monitor less extensively, typically for security and parental control purposes.

## Common Myths and Misconceptions

**Misconception: Similar to cell phone companies, I can shop around for the best internet price and choose any internet company that I want (RCN, Comcast, AT&T, etc.) to be my service provider.**

ISP coverage is geographically constrained unlike cellular carriers. FCC data reveals RCN and WOW don't serve entire Chicago. Though FCC data sometimes reports unavailable services as available, provider disparities remain clear. Different ISPs offer varying speeds in different neighborhoods depending on installed infrastructure.

**Myth: If I have a weak Wi-Fi signal in my apartment, it is because my internet service provider is not providing the internet speeds that my contract dictates.**

ISPs typically lease equipment outperforming contracted bandwidth. Personal equipment might prove inadequate. Simple improvements help: moving Wi-Fi from metal objects, placing it high (bookshelves), or moving closer. Chicago's common stone and brick materials impede Wi-Fi transmission more than open air or wood.
